Monitor your [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) build process and Jamstack application performance with [New Relic](https://newrelic.com/), without the need for lengthy manual set up.

Built for developers who want to know how their deploys are impacting site performance for users, the New Relic Plugin for Netlify enables you to: 

- Automatically install the [New Relic browser agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/introduction-browser-monitoring/) and notify New Relic each time a [build event](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/build-plugins/create-plugins/#plug-into-events) occurs in Netlify. Get critical insights via [Real User Monitoring (RUM)](https://newrelic.com/products/browser-monitoring) into the performance of your Jamstack application.
- Understand how each deploy impacts your site’s performance metrics in production.
- Measure Google Core Web vitals on your site like Largest Contentful Paint, First Input Delay, and Cumulative Layout shift.
- Quickly discover and fix errors before they impact your users. 
- Explore your data using our custom-built dashboards and receive alerts/notifications when there’s an issue with your Netlify site. Installing the New Relic Netlify Plugin

## Installation

To install the plugin, log into your New Relic account (or sign up for a [free account](https://newrelic.com/signup?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=content&utm_campaign=amer-ever-green-netlify_plugin&utm_content=webpage))
- (New User): You will receive an email address to verify your account
- Click [here](https://onenr.io/0a2wdY8koRE) to go straight to browser install
- Create a [New Relic ingest license key](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#ingest-license-key) and a [New Relic browser ingest license key.](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#ingest-browser-key) 

### UI Installation

[UI installation](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/build-plugins/#ui-installation) is the quickest way to start using the plugin, and does not require any modifications to your project's code.

- Navigate to the [Netlify plugin directory](https://app.netlify.com/plugins), search for New Relic, and select install and then choose which of your Netlify sites will use the plugin
- Go to your site settings > build and deploy > environment and set the following [environment variables](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/environment-variables/):
  - NEWRELIC_ACCOUNT_ID: Your [New Relic Account ID](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/account-id/)
  - NEWRELIC_INGEST_LICENSE_KEY: A New Relic [ingest license key](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#ingest-license-key)
  - NEWRELIC_BROWSER_LICENSE_KEY: A New Relic [browser ingest license key](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#ingest-browser-key)
  - NEWRELIC_APP_ID: Your New Relic [Browser App ID](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/get-started/get-app-other-ids-new-relic-one/#browser)
  - ENABLE_BROWSER_MONITORING: Set this to true

### File-based Installation

Alternatively, to install with [file-based installation](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/build-plugins/#file-based-installation), add the following lines to your `netlify.toml` files:

```[[plugins]]
package = "@newrelic/netlify-plugin"

  [plugins.inputs]
    newrelicAccountId = "123456"
    newrelicLicenseKey = "12345678901234567890"
    newrelicBrowserLicenseKey = "ABCD-0987654321"
    newrelicAppId = "123456789"
    enableBrowserMonitoring = true
```

Replace the values for `newrelicAccountId`, `newrelicLicenseKey`, `newrelicBrowserLicenseKey`, and `newrelicAppId` with your New Relic Account ID, the ingest and browser ingest license key you, and your New Relic Browser App ID.

## Install the Netlify quickstart

To get the most out of your Netlify integration you should also install the New Relic Netlify quickstart. You can find more information on the quickstart page on [New Relic I/O](https://newrelic.com/platform/about-instant-observability).

## Settings

The plugin allows for customisation of the following settings via environment variables or your `netlify.toml`.
